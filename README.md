# SignUpForm

Instructions:
Create an Android application to collect a user’s name, email, a password, and a password
confirmation on its main activity. It should also contain a Save button.
When the user clicks the Save button, it will display a message containing the user’s name, welcoming
them to the app. e.g. “Welcome, Jayne Dough, to the SignUpForm App”
As always, please ensure that your application has a proper Git commit trail that shows your progress
throughout the development process. It is not sufficient to only have a single commit with all your code
at the end of the project, and you may be penalized if that is the case.
